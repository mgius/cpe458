We shared ideas and code, but developed separately, so our code will be very
simiilar, but not identical.

Simply type "make" to compile the program and output an aggregated result of
1000 runs of my player vs my partners

This project works. Some of the code is more verbose, but for this project
I strived to ignore if/while/for, etc, so sometimes I did something silly
when it might have been more concise to use an if/while/for.  

I spent very little time thinking about how to create a "perfect" player, but
I thought about a player that would look some short amount of time into the
future, and make decisions based on that.  So my player looks at the
potential outcomes for the next 2 turns, and issues a double based on that.

My player always accepts a challenge.  He's a drunken gambler at heart, he is.
